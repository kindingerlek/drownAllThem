# DrownAllThem!

**The Game:** You are in control of a beach with sunbathers. Your mission is to drown them all. For this you will be provided with some power-ups, which are divided into 2 groups, the attractive and the offensive. The attractive powerups will bring more people to your beach, while the offensive ones will increase the aggressiveness of the sea. Each new drowning, more points, and better the power-ups stand.
